This project is part of the ALX Integrated Data Analysis series, focused on United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.
The aim was to explore global access to safe and affordable drinking water using 2020 data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) 
What I Did:
Imported and cleaned the dataset containing water access levels (basic, limited, unimproved, surface) for different countries, ensuring correct formatting and handling missing values.
Created new calculated features such as population in millions, rural/urban population shares, and rounded values for better visualization.
Analyzed population patterns at national, rural, and urban levels, comparing dataset totals with global population estimates.
Calculated statistical measures (mean, median, mode, quartiles, IQR, standard deviation) to understand distribution and variability of water access.
Created visualizations including:
Line charts comparing urban vs. rural population shares
Box-and-whisker plots for water access across areas
100% stacked column charts for national
Pivot tables linking income groups to water access levels
Interpreted insights about how income group, population size, and urbanisation relate to water access.
Key Insight:
The analysis showed that higher income levels and greater urbanization are generally associated with higher access to basic water services, while low-income and rural areas face more challenges in achieving universal access.
