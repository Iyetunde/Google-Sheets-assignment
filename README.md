Google Sheets Assignment

This project is part of the ALX Integrated Data Analysis series, focused on United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.

Project Aim
The aim was to explore global access to safe and affordable drinking water using 2020 data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP).

 What I Did
- Imported and cleaned the dataset containing water access levels:
  - Basic
  - Limited
  - Unimproved Surface  

- Ensured correct formatting and handled missing values.  

- Created new calculated features such as:
  - Population in millions
  - Rural/urban population shares
  - Rounded values for better visualization  

- Analyzed population patterns at:
  - National level
  - Rural vs. urban levels  
  - Compared dataset totals with global population estimates  

- Calculated statistical measures:
  - Mean, Median, Mode
  - Quartiles, IQR
  - Standard Deviation  
  These helped to understand distribution and variability of water access.  

Visualizations Created
-  Line charts comparing **urban vs. rural population shares  
-  Box-and-whisker plots for water access across areas  
-  100% stacked column charts (national comparisons)  


Tools Used
- Google Sheets (data cleaning, calculations, and visualization)  
- WHO/UNICEF JMP dataset (2020) 


Key Insights
- Urban areas generally had higher levels of basic water access compared to rural areas.  
- Surface water reliance was more common in rural regions.  
- Variability of water access highlighted the gap between global targets and regional realities.
